The solution depends on the root cause. If it's a typo, simply correct the class name. If it's a missing plugin or configuration, add the plugin and configure Tailwind to include it. Below is an example assuming the error is a typo.

**Incorrect (bug.html):**
```html
<div class="@apply bg-red-500">
</div>
```

**Corrected (solution.html):**
```html
<div class="@apply bg-red-500">
</div>
```

**tailwind.config.js:**  Ensure your config is correct and includes the `bg-red-500` utility if you're not using a plugin that provides it. If you are using a plugin make sure to correctly configure it.  For instance:
```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [ "./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
Note that plugins must be listed in the `plugins` array in `tailwind.config.js`.  This is often missed.
